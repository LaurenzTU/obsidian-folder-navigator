## Why Folder Navigator?

I really enjoy using Obsidian's file search feature, which allows us to quickly search for files and navigate to them. There are also third-party plugins that further enhance this experience.

However, I need to navigate to folders in a similar way. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a method to do this, either by using Obsidian's official features or third-party plugins. That's why I'm developing this plugin to achieve that. **It allows you to navigate to folders just as you can when navigating to files.**
