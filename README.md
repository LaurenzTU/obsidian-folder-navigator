An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that allows you to quickly navigate to folders in your vault using fuzzy search.

## Features

- Quick folder navigation using fuzzy search
- Configurable maximum number of search results
- Expand target folder on navigation
- Works with nested folders

## Why Folder Navigator?

I really enjoy using Obsidian's file search feature, which allows us to quickly search for files and navigate to them. There are also third-party plugins that further enhance this experience.

However, I need to navigate to folders in a similar way. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a method to do this, either by using Obsidian's official features or third-party plugins. That's why I'm developing this plugin to achieve that. **It allows you to navigate to folders just as you can when navigating to files.**

## Usage

1. Press the hotkey (default: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O) to open the folder search modal
2. Type to search for folders - the search is fuzzy, so you don't need to type the exact name
3. Use arrow keys to navigate through the results
4. Press Enter to select a folder and navigate to it in the file explorer

## Settings

- **Maximum results**: Set the maximum number of folders to show in search results (5-50)
- **Expand target folder on navigation**: When enabled, folders will be automatically expanded when you navigate to them

## Installation

1. Open Settings in Obsidian
2. Navigate to Community Plugins and disable Safe Mode
3. Click Browse and search for "Folder Navigator"
4. Install the plugin
5. Enable the plugin in the Community Plugins tab

## Manual Installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/wenlzhang/obsidian-folder-navigator/releases)
2. Extract the files into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-folder-navigator/` directory
3. Reload Obsidian
4. Enable the plugin in Settings > Community Plugins
